-- Family Finance Buddy — resetting the demo household.
--
-- "Reset wipes and reseeds it to a known state, so you can experiment
-- destructively without care." (§468) And the stage 3 gate: "you can switch
-- between two households and nothing leaks between them; reset restores a
-- known state."
--
-- ── the exception this is, and why it is one ─────────────────────────────
--
-- Deletes are soft everywhere. Members are archived, expenses are voided, and
-- lot, disposal and fx_rate have no delete grant at all, because a figure
-- somebody relied on does not get to vanish. Nothing in a real household is
-- ever hard-deleted, and this file does not change that.
--
-- A demo household is where nobody relies on anything. Every figure in it is
-- invented, which is the whole reason it exists — and a sandbox that cannot be
-- emptied fills up with the last experiment's leftovers until nobody can tell
-- a seeded edge case from a test typed in by hand. So this is a hard delete,
-- and it refuses on anything not marked `demo`. That refusal is the invariant,
-- restated for the one place it bends.
--
-- ── what survives ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- Access, not data. The household row, every member somebody signs in as,
-- every membership and every invite stay exactly as they were: resetting the
-- sandbox must not lock out the person you handed it to. Name and currencies
-- stay too. The FIRE inputs go back to their defaults, because they shape
-- every figure on that screen and a known state has to include them.
--
-- The audit log survives in full. It is append-only and nothing here is
-- granted a way around that — every row removed writes its own 'delete' entry
-- through the ordinary trigger, naming the person who reset. That trail IS the
-- record of the reset; a separate 'reset' action would be a summary of it.
--
-- ── why the seed moves into a function ───────────────────────────────────
--
-- Reseeding needs the seed to be somewhere the database can call it. Until now
-- it lived only in supabase/seed/demo_edge_cases.sql, pasted into the SQL
-- editor. There is no server of ours to run a file from, so the body moves
-- here, and that file becomes a few lines that call it. One copy, two callers.

-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ the seed

/**
 * Fill a demo household with the awkward cases.
 *
 * "A seed of tidy data proves only that tidy data works." Everything below is
 * here because it is awkward: a category nobody used, a month with no reading,
 * a spend on the last day of a tax year, an entry one member cannot see.
 *
 * `seeded_by` is the account recorded as having entered it, and the member
 * that account is becomes the household's own member in the fixture.
 *
 * Returns false and does nothing if the household has already been seeded:
 * re-running a seed is a mistake rather than a request for two of everything.
 *
 * INVOKER, and granted to nobody. It is reached two ways — from the reset
 * below, which has already checked the caller, and from the SQL editor as the
 * project owner. A client has no path to it.
