-- Family Finance Buddy — what the FIRE projection assumes belongs to the household.
--
-- The projection (blueprint §06) is c(n+1) = c(n)(1 + r) + sip(n), with the contribution raised by a
-- step-up each year. Its three inputs are judgements, not facts, and for the reason the multiplier, the
-- inflation and the horizon went onto the household row (20260909120000) they go here too: a couple
-- planning together must be looking at one projection, and one phone's answer must not be another's.
--
-- Additive and defaulted: every existing household reads 10% a year, a flat contribution and nothing
-- put in. 10% is an assumption and not the least one (0% would be); it is the figure the screen states
-- beside every date it gives, and the household's to change. The household row already has its update
-- policy (owner and partner) and its table grant, and its audit trigger records the change; a column
-- added to it is covered by all three, so nothing is granted or enabled again here.

  add column fire_return_pct numeric(5, 2) not null default 10
    check (fire_return_pct >= 0 and fire_return_pct <= 50),

  add column fire_monthly_contribution_minor bigint not null default 0
    check (fire_monthly_contribution_minor >= 0);

comment on column public.household.fire_return_pct is
  'The assumed annual return on the corpus, per cent. A judgement, which is why it is a household setting; capped at 50 because past that it stops being an assumption.';
comment on column public.household.fire_step_up_pct is
  'How much the monthly contribution is raised each year, per cent. Zero is a flat contribution.';
comment on column public.household.fire_monthly_contribution_minor is
  'What the household puts in each month, in its own currency (base_currency), in minor units. An assumption about the future, not a record of what was paid in.';

-- ────────────────────────────────────────────── a reset puts them back
--
-- reset_demo_household returns the household to a known state, and its update of the household row
-- named the three FIRE settings it knew. A reset that left the new three where somebody had set them
-- would not be a reset. The function is otherwise as 20260918120000 left it, with one addition it
-- should have had since 20260927130000: it now clears the deposit and bond tables, below.
